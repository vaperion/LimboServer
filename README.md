# LimboServer

I originally started working on this project in January.\
I decided to open-source it as I'm not working on it anymore.

I used plain java sockets to handle connections (I did not want to use Netty).\
I used Toml (https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) for the configuration file.

The server is fully functional except encryption (so onlineMode will not work).
